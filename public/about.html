<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Juliette, a web designer with extensive experience in UI/UX, branding, marketing, and sustainability solutions. 
  I am passionate about helping businesses transform and accelerate into something more than just a business, but a brand. 
  I strive for excellence in myself and my work, pushing myself to demonstrate that greater accomplishments can be achieved through sheer determination and commitment. 
  However, I also value balance.</p>

<p>Visual art theories and psychology, human-computer interaction psychology, leading design tools, social trends, and brand atmosphere. 
  I have strengths in leadership, delegation, and problem-solving. I enjoy leading a team and finding the most efficient ways to accomplish tasks. 
  I have a lot of experience with Scrums and Sprints, which shaped my work ethic and ability to achieve goals more accurately in a timely manner, as well as simultaneously working alongside the team to coordinate task completion. 
  I have also gained a lot of experience leading teams remotely over the past two years.</p>

<p>I attended Milnerton High School from 2013-2017, where I received 5 distinctions and achieved a 97% grade in Visual Art. 
  I went on to obtain a BUSINESS INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY DEGREE from AFDA, where I made the Dean's list and won the Best UI and UX Design Award. 
  I furthered my education with a UI and UX Course at Georgia Institute of Technology, and a 5-week In-Depth Extensive Figma and UI and UX Course on Udemy.</p>
